\chapter{Abstract}
The main goal of this Bachelor thesis is to detect and track objects in an image sequence. This image sequence is being recorded by an IP camera, in order to enable the system to evaluate the recorded video from anywhere, while having access to an internet connection. The objects which are supposed to be detected and tracked are ships and boats on a river.

An additional goal is to research if the detected and tracked boats can be classified by their properties in order to detect some further patterns in the ship traffic on the river.

The prototype being crated in the course of this thesis is going to prove the theory of the approaches developed in this thesis and it consists of a hardware and a software side.

The detection, trackind and classification is going to be implemented using known and proven computer vision algorithms. Moreover the robustness against weather influences should be a goal of the thesis.
