\chapter{Abstract}
The main goal of the Bachelor thesis is to detect and track ships and boats on a live video stream. Further it is to research by which properties the boats can be classified, in order to 
create some sort of patterns and statistics about the traffic on the river. 
The hardware of the system needs to be developed, in order to create a weatherproff installation of the camera. The prototype is supposed to be portable to any other part of the river, whereas the system needs to be adjustablable to other environments, like different lighting, weather and viewpoint situations. 
The detection and recognition of the boats is going to be implemented using known and common computer vision algorithms and is supposed to be resistent to different weather infliences. For classifying the boats, methods of machine learning are supposed to be researched and compared to other approaches.
